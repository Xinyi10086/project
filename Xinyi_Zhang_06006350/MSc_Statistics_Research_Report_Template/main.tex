\begin{abstract}
    Direct discovery of governing equations remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning, especially under noisy measurement conditions. This thesis develops two frameworks for sparse polynomial model selection. First, we introduce a Bayesian evidence–based approach that directly computes posterior model probabilities, thereby implementing Occam’s razor in a principled way. This framework addresses the case where noise is present only in the response variable, balancing model fit with parsimony without relying on asymptotic approximations such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Second, to tackle the more challenging error-in-variables (EIV) problem where both predictors and responses are noisy, we propose the Sequentially Thresholded Least Squares with Orthogonal Distance Regression (STLSQ-ODR). This method combines sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) with ODR’s ability to correct for measurement error, providing robust recovery of governing equations under Gaussian, heavy-tailed, or correlated noise. 
    Simulation studies demonstrate that the Bayesian razor effectively identifies parsimonious models when noise is confined to the response variable, while STLSQ-ODR provides more reliable recovery under the EIV problem. 
    Across noise structures, BIC-based thresholding consistently outperforms OLS-based selection in stability, although all methods deteriorate under extreme noise. Overall, the findings highlight Bayesian evidence and ODR regression as complementary approaches for sparse model discovery under noisy conditions, laying the groundwork for extensions to higher-dimensional and practical applications.
